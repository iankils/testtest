[![Review Assignment Due Date](https://classroom.github.com/assets/deadline-readme-button-22041afd0340ce965d47ae6ef1cefeee28c7c493a6346c4f15d667ab976d596c.svg)](https://classroom.github.com/a/V2J_ymkQ)
For this assignment you are going to "prettify" one of Mr. Blank's bland emails that he sends on a regular basis. You know the one's I am talking about, just plain text and no style.

You will first need to research the process on how to send an html email.
Then, you will need to find an old email from Mr. Blank and come up with a design that will work for the audience.

After lots of planning and prepping, then you can begin to code your html email.

All of this will be done on GitHub classroom, but you will also email me your final email.

This is due next Tuesday (15/10)!
